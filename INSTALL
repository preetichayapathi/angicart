INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

angicart depends on ocaml and several other open-source unix utilities.  These
instructions are written with Linux and Mac OS in mind, but an intrepid person
may be able to adapt them to windows.  Lines beginning with $ are meant to be
typed at the command-line (Terminal) without the $.  Lines beginning with # are
meant to be typed at a root shell.  If you need help, please contact Mitchell,
the author.

1. Obtain and install git.

Use whatever method works for you.  General instructions can be found at
  http://git-scm.com/download

If you have Debian stable: 
  # apt-get install git
If you have macports: 
  $ sudo port install git-core

2. Obtain and install ocaml and ocaml packages.

We recommend using the GODI distribution of ocaml, since it comes with an easy
way to install the ocaml libraries that angicart depends on.  We do not
recommend macports for installing ocaml libraries, although Debian may be fine.
GODI requires wget, which can be obtained from your package management system:

macports: $ sudo port install wget
homebrew: $ sudo brew install wget
debian: # apt-get install wget

To install godi, follow the instructions on the GODI installation page,
  http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/get_godi.html

Once you can run godi_console, follow its onscreen instructions to install the
ocaml libraries that angicart depends on.  More detailed instructions for this
step are below.  The required packages are: 
  godi-batteries, godi-camlimages, and godi-lablgl.
It's important to configure godi-camlimages so that the
'GODI_CAMLIMAGES_WITH_LAB$' options and the 'GODI_CAMLIMAGES_WITH_GIF' option
are set to 'no' to avoid unnecessary dependencies such as gtk.

Detailed instructions: start godi_console, then enter '2' to select source
packages.  Then you can use arrow keys to scroll to the package.  If you enter
the package number, you'll be taken to a screen where you can type 'b' to mark
for build and installation and 'c' to configure it.  Configuration is only
required for godi-camlimages; It's fine to leave everything else as it is.
When all the packages are selected and configured, hit 's' to perform the
build.  Hopefully it works!

3. Obtain angicart and run it

Get angicart; this will create a directory called angicart in the current
directory.
  $ git clone git@github.com:mnewberry/angicart.git

Enter that directory
  $ cd angicart

Run the graphdisplay program to see if everything works.
  $ ./make.sh graphdisplay run --help

If you see the help screen (and not an error), then everything is working fine.
